Simple PHP script that solves labyrinth.
===========================================

One of recruitment test that I had was to represent labyrinth structure in PHP
and write algorithm that solves it.
You can find many implementations on the web but most of them are procedural.
I decided to develop my own solution.

===========================================

Run test.php with example labyrinth to see how it works.
Read comments and look at flowchart to understand.
